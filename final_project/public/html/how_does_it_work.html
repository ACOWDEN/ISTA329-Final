			<h3>How Blockchains Work</h3>
			As databases, blockchains keep an unchangeable history of all the 
			transactions made by users. Rather than existing as a single instance 
			like we're used to, it exists as thousands of instances around the world 
			on computers like yours. So rather than being updated by a single entity, 
			it is updated by a group of entities, each running their own copy of the 
			blockchain database and collectively agreeing on how to update their 
			copy. Rather than updating the blockchain with each individual 
			transaction as it is made, the blockchain database is periodically 
			updated with groups of transactions called “blocks”. Once a block is 
			added to the blockchain, it cannot be removed or changed.
			<br><br>
			Blockchains are networks made up of a bunch of computers called “nodes”. 
			When users do something on a blockchain, whether it be sending digital 
			assets or interacting with an application, they are making a transaction 
			from a node. This node could be running on their own computer, or they 
			could connect to another person's node instead of running their own (RPC).
			When a user tries to make a transaction, the node stores it in its 
			mempool (sort of like a waiting room) and shares the transaction with 
			other computers in the network. These computers similarly put the 
			transaction in their own mempool and continue to share the transaction 
			with other nodes.
			<br><br>
			These unconfirmed transactions sitting in each node's mempool are waiting 
			to be added into a block. Every few seconds (or maybe even minutes), a 
			new block is ready to be filled with transactions and added to the 
			blockchain. Someone has to fill and add the block though, so one node in 
			the network is randomly selected to fill a new block with the 
			transactions in their mempool, then share it with the other nodes in the 
			network.
			<br><br>
			The block proposer node adds the block to their own copy of the 
			blockchain. If the nodes they share the block with agree that the block 
			is valid, those nodes also add the block to their copy of the blockchain 
			and continue to share the block.
			<br><br>
			Users make transactions on the blockchain using a blockchain wallet. A 
			transaction may be sending crypto assets or interacting with some 
			application.
			<br><br>
			If you make a transaction, you add it to the blockchain database 
			yourself, or you can trust someone else to do it (RPC). Once you add it 
			to your own copy of the blockchain, all the other nodes in the network 
			just like yours verify that the transaction is valid. If they agree it's 
			valid, they add it to their copy of the blockchain database. Similarly, 
			your node will receive transactions that are made by others, and the 
			node's software will verify that the transaction is valid before it adds 
			it to your copy of the database.
			<br><br>
			This is how a database can exist not as a single instance, but a bunch of 
			instances that are all the same and update “in unison”. In this, no 
			single entity can change the blockchain database or remove data from it, 
			as all other nodes in the network will not recognize this change as valid 
			and therefore not make it to their own databases. Similarly, if anyone 
			inserts an invalid transaction to be added to the blockchain, it will not 
			be recognized by the rest of the network.
