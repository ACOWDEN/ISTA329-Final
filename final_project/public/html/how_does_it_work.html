			<h3>How Blockchains Work</h3>
			A blockchain is database network that securely records transactions across a 
			bunch of different computers. Multiple copies of the blockchain system exist 
			and run on different devices (nodes) that anyone can join in running themselves. 
			<br><br>
			When a user makes a transaction, it is verified by every device in the network
			and waits to be added to the unchangeable history of transactions. When it's
			ready, the transaction, along with other transactions waiting to be added, is 
			compiled into a "block" and added to the history of transactions
			(all the previous blocks). This creates a chronological history of transactions
			made on the network, proving the context of every user's current balance at any given time.
			Once a block is added, it cannot be changed or removed from the network.
			<br><br>
			Consensus is vital in this process. Agreement among all these devices (consensus) 
			ensures accurate transaction records without a central controller. It ensures 
			that all the copies of the ledger agree on the transactions and the order they're 
			added. Each device running the blockchain software will only update their history
			of transactions if they agree that the update is valid.
			<br><br>
			This is how a database can exist not as a single instance, but a bunch of 
			instances that are all the same and update “in unison”. In this, no 
			single entity can change the blockchain database or remove data from it, 
			as all other nodes in the network will not recognize this change as valid 
			and therefore not make it to their own databases. Similarly, if anyone 
			inserts an invalid transaction to be added to the blockchain, it will not 
			be recognized by the rest of the network.
			Users make transactions on the blockchain using a blockchain wallet. A 
			transaction may be sending crypto assets or interacting with some 
			application.
			<br><br>
			<h3>Basic Blockchain Simulation</h3>
			The interactive simulation below gives a high level idea of how a blockchain
			works. There are three buttons, "BUY", "SELL", and "SEND" that represent the
			most common types of transactions being made on the blockchain today. As a
			transaction is made, it sits in the mempool waiting to be added into a block.
			Once the blocktime of 5 seconds has passed (or 10 transaction have been made, 
			filling up the block), the new transactions are compiled into to the new block
			and added to the tip of the blockchain.
