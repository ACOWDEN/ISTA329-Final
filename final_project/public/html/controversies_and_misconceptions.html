			<h2>Controversies and Misconceptions</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="article-container">
			<h3>Crypto Is For Criminals</h3>
			A common point made about cryptocurrency is that it is used by criminals as a 
			way to facilitate their illicit activity. It's good to remember that according 
			to <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2023-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">Chainalysis</a> 
			(a blockchain research group often cited by U.S. government officials) less 
			than 1% of all crypto activity in 2023 was illicit.
			<br><br>
			Regardless, blockchains uniquely possess what is known as <a href="https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/">
			"credible neutrality".</a> They are systems that follow a mechanism in which there 
			exists no possibility of discrimination for or against certain users of the system.
			Blockchains could not possibly maintain their safety guarantees if there did
			exist a way to arbitrarily discriminate who can use the system and how they can
			use it.
			<br><br>
			<h3>Blockchains Waste Energy</h3>
			Blockchains are often controversial due to their energy consumption which is
			required for certain networks to achieve consensus. However, this is only
			a legitimate concern for blockchains that use a Proof of Work consensus algorithm,
			which requires computers to expend energy in order to add valid blocks to the chain.
			Most public networks today use a Proof of Stake algorithm, which <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/energy-consumption/">
			consumes less energy</a> per transaction than a tweet on Twitter.
			<br><br>
			<h3>All Cryptocurrencies Are the Same</h3>
			Cryptocurrencies are generally perceived to all be the same, each competing to
			be the "winner" in the race to be the next digital cash. Hence, it seems super
			redundant to have so many crypto assets in existence. This is a short-sighted
			view of cryptocurrencies that overlooks the purpose of blockchains and crypto
			assets in general, which is not to serve as a slightly better form of digital
			cash. While there exists some overlap in the crypto assets that exist
			today, there are <a href="https://www.kraken.com/learn/types-of-cryptocurrency">
			various niches of blockchain applications</a> in which a crypto asset may 
			correspond with as a utility token. There are very few crypto assets today 
			that exist to serve as digital cash, and most that do are  stablecoins backed 
			by deposited cash in the real world.
			<br><br>
			<h3>Cryptocurrency is Full of Scams/Exploits</h3>
			Blockchains and cryptocurrency are often criticized for the "wild west" environment
			that exists with blockchain applications today. Specifically, cryptocurrency
			investors and app users are constantly subjected to the risk of losing their
			funds to an <a href="https://defillama.com/hacks">exploited smart contract</a>, 
			developers that abandon their project, or outright scammers that manage to 
			steal money from their users. While there are bad actors that put users and their
			funds at risk, there is still a healthy majority of successful and thriving
			projects in the industry today. Decentralized finance applications alone
			secure over $40 billion in deposited value, and this number is constantly growing.
			<br><br>
			<h3>Cryptocurrency is Too Slow and Expensive</h3>
			Those familiar with the fees incurred on some blockchain networks know that they
			can get uncomfortably high when the network is busy. Blockchain networks charge the same fee for
			transactions regardless of the amount being used, so while fees do not discriminate
			based on transaction size, this can pose a barrier for users who are only able
			to transact with smaller amounts. While years ago this was a serious issue (the
			issue of blockchain scalability), modern scaling solutions like layer 2 networks
			and other unique blockchain networks have emerged to significantly reduce the costs of 
			transactions to less than a penny regardless of the size.
			<br><br>
			<h3>Cryptocurrency is a Ponzi Scheme</h3>
			The debate around the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin often stirs the
			question: is cryptocurrency a ponzi scheme? <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/bitcoin-ponzi-scheme/">
			Lyn Alden</a> addresses this characterization by highlighting the absence of 
			ponzi scheme features in Bitcoin (and similarly a majority of other 
			cryptocurrencies). 
			<br><br>
			Firstly, blockchain networks like Bitcoin have no company 
			which is yielding value to the asset, no company promising returns on the 
			asset, and no "leader" growing the network or its popularity. Assets are 
			priced entirely by the free market's value perception (admittedly, a large 
			portion of which is speculative). Another key component of blockchains 
			and cryptocurrency is their live, tamper-proof transparency of network activity 
			and history, while one would normally expect opacity from a supposed ponzi scheme.
			A final crucial point is that most cryptocurrencies derive their underlying
			value from their overall utility, which creates demand, rather than deriving
			their value from artificial demand or depending on new investors for growth.
			For example, as more applications and users exist on a blockchain network, more
			transactions will be made on the network, creating more demand for the network's
			native asset (e.g., ETH), therefore driving the value of the asset up. This is
			done entirely without the involvement of a speculative investor.
			<br><br>
			<h3>NFTs Are Pointless</h3>
			NFTs create a lot of controversy around their inflated value and seemingly
			non-existant value proposition. What this often overlooks is the infinite potential
			of NFTs beyond just digital art on the blockchain. NFTs can be used for
			blockchain applications like social media and providing user profiles, games 
			and providing users ownership over their in-game items and their market value,
			and <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/nft/">much more</a>.
