			<h3>Basic Assumptions and Black Swan Events</h3>
			Before we talk risks, it's good to remember the basic assumptions we make 
			when talking about blockchains and cryptocurrency. This is to highlight the 
			basis of many of the claims we make about the security of blockchains and how 
			they work in general. Specifically, we assume:
			<ol>
				<li>cryptography works</li>
				<li>the Internet exists</li>
			</ol>
			If cryptography breaks or the Internet ceases to exist, then like most of the 
			world, blockchains and cryptocurrency would lose their unique guarantees of 
			safety. This trickles into the concept of “black swan events”, or 
			unpredictable catastrophic events that often lead to collapse. A meteor 
			destroying the Earth could be considered a black swan event, for example. 
			These events would similarly eliminate the cryptographic safety guarantees of 
			blockchain systems.
			<br><br>
			<h3>Blockchain Security Risks</h3>
			While blockchains are exponentially more resilient and secure than the 
			systems we use today, they aren't invincible. Outside of black swan events, 
			there are still scenarios where blockchains can be successfully attacked. 
			This is done by disrupting consensus. If an adversary gains control of 51% or 
			more of a network's hash power or stake, they can manipulate the network and 
			our ability to transact may be impacted.
			<br><br>
			<h3>Self Custody Risks</h3>
			The ability to custody and verify ownership of our assets without relying on 
			any middleman is a huge achievement, but does not come without tradeoffs. 
			With blockchains there is no “higher authority” that can revert transactions 
			or freeze our account for any reason. This means we are 100% responsible for 
			keeping our blockchain account's private key and seed phrase safe, and we 
			must avoid scams that trick us into sending our money away. Once a 
			transaction is made on the blockchain, it is irreversible.
			<br><br>
			<h3>Smart Contract Risks</h3>
			The apps that exist on blockchains offer fundamentally different safety 
			guarantees compared to systems we use today. The smart contracts that make up 
			these applications are immutable, meaning the creator cannot change the code 
			once it is on the blockchain, and they are open source, so we can know 
			exactly how the app works and processes our transactions. However, like any 
			code, smart contracts can have bugs which are exploitable and may put user's 
			funds at risk of being stolen. Similarly, the creator may include “backdoor” 
			functions in the contract's code that gives them the ability to steal 
			deposited funds. This highlights the importance of checking for audits from 
			reputable smart contract auditing companies before using an application.
			<br><br>
			<h3>Regulatory Uncertainty</h3>
			In the United States, there is still no well-defined regulatory standards for 
			cryptocurrency assets and blockchain technology. This means legislation can 
			still be introduced at any point which impacts the legality of this 
			technology. This would not affect the system or applications themselves, as 
			even the U.S. government cannot take down today's public blockchains nor the 
			applications built on them. It would simply affect U.S. citizens' ability to 
			use this technology.
			<br><br>
			<h3>Cryptocurrency Investing Risks</h3>
			When purchasing cryptocurrency assets as an investment rather than as a 
			utility asset, this comes with the same risks as any other investment. As an 
			emerging technology with high speculation however, cryptocurrency is 
			particularly volatile and risky from an investment perspective.
