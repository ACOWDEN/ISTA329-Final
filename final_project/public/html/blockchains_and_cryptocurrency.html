			<h3>Refresher</h3>
			By now, we've covered the main features of the systems that make our world go
			round today. We've highlighted that these systems are far from perfect, and that
			they come with important tradeoffs all of which are ultimately rooted in the need
			to trust other people. Simply put, we are always vulnerable to the bias,
			corruption, or neglect of whoever has control in the systems we use.
			<br><br>
			<h3>What is a Blockchain?</h3>
			Try not to think too hard on the word “blockchain” itself, let's just talk the 
			basics. Blockchains are a new way to build the trust-based systems in our lives, 
			but trustlessly. If that seems a little confusing, let's use the Internet as an 
			example. The Internet was a new a way to build the non-digital systems of our 
			everyday lives, but digitally. Blockchains aren't trying to replace the Internet, 
			but like the Internet, they are useful tools for radically improving the 
			systems we use today with <em>much</em> better trade-offs.
			<br><br>
			The most basic (but not the only) function of a blockchain is to let us store and 
			use digital money trustlessly. However unlike a bank or a digital payment 
			provider, blockchains are not controlled by a single entity; they are 
			decentralized. This design removes the single points of failure that we suffer 
			from in the services we use today.
			<br><br>
			There is no system controller deciding who can and cannot use a blockchain, it's 
			permissionless. Anyone can create a blockchain account, and no authority exists 
			which can “ban” this account or control how it uses the blockchain. Users never 
			have to worry about some system authority closing or freezing their account for 
			any reason, and digital finance becomes vastly more accessible for anyone in the 
			world with an Internet connection. Creating an account is functionally as simple 
			as clicking a button, putting no personal information at risk since none is 
			required.
			<br><br>
			With blockchain accounts and any assets stored within them, users get absolute 
			ownership. Not only does no middleman exist with control over users' accounts, 
			but users do not need a middleman to run the system they want to use. Instead, 
			users can run the blockchain software directly on their own devices. This means 
			with blockchains, we can make peer-to-peer (p2p) transactions with any other 
			account 24/7, where there is no middleman in control of our account or the 
			system, and therefore no middleman between us and the people we transact with.
			<br><br>
			<h3>Building Apps on a Blockchain</h3>
			Now while it's great that anyone in the world can use a blockchain for storing 
			and using digital money trustlessly, this is kind of boring. Sure, this covers 
			simple financial services like banks and payment providers, but didn't we say 
			that we can use blockchains to build any of the trust-based systems in our lives?
			Well, just like the Internet, we can build applications that use this core 
			functionality of blockchains! By default, the blockchain doesn't offer some 
			platform for trading stocks and commodities, taking out loans, or getting 
			insurance, but these are apps that can be built on a blockchain. There is no 
			built-in games or social media platforms, but these can be built on a blockchain 
			too.
