			<h3>Refresher</h3>
			By now, we've covered the main features of the systems that make our world go
			round today. We've highlighted that these systems are far from perfect, and that
			they come with important tradeoffs all of which are ultimately rooted in the need
			to trust other people. Simply put, we are always vulnerable to the bias,
			corruption, or neglect of whoever has control in the systems we use.
			<br><br>
			
			<h3>What is a Blockchain?</h3>
			Try not to think too hard on the word “blockchain” itself, let's just talk the 
			basics. Blockchains are a new way to build the trust-based systems in our lives, 
			but trustlessly. If that seems a little confusing, let's use the Internet as an 
			example. The Internet was a new a way to build the non-digital systems of our 
			everyday lives, but digitally. Blockchains aren't trying to replace the Internet, 
			but like the Internet, they are useful tools for radically improving the 
			systems we use today with <em>much</em> better trade-offs.
			<br><br>
			The most basic (but not the only) function of a blockchain is to let us store and 
			use digital money trustlessly. However unlike a bank or a digital payment 
			provider, blockchains are not controlled by a single entity; they are 
			decentralized. This design removes the single points of failure that we suffer 
			from in the services we use today.
			<br><br>
			There is no system controller deciding who can and cannot use a blockchain, it's 
			permissionless. Anyone can create a blockchain account, and no authority exists 
			which can “ban” this account or control how it uses the blockchain. Users never 
			have to worry about some system authority closing or freezing their account for 
			any reason, and digital finance becomes vastly more accessible for anyone in the 
			world with an Internet connection. Creating an account is functionally as simple 
			as clicking a button, putting no personal information at risk since none is 
			required.
			<br><br>
			With blockchain accounts and any assets stored within them, users get absolute 
			ownership. Not only does no middleman exist with control over users' accounts, 
			but users do not need a middleman to run the system they want to use. Instead, 
			users can run the blockchain software directly on their own devices. This means 
			with blockchains, we can make peer-to-peer (p2p) transactions with any other 
			account 24/7, where there is no middleman in control of our account or the 
			system, and therefore no middleman between us and the people we transact with.
			<br><br>
			
			<h3>Building Apps on a Blockchain</h3>
			Now while it's great that anyone in the world can use a blockchain for storing 
			and using digital money trustlessly, didn't we say that we can use blockchains 
			to build any of the trust-based systems in our lives? Well, just like the 
			Internet, we can build applications that harness the underlying core function
			of blockchains! This means we can build financial applications, games, social
			media platforms, websites, or anything else that we can write with code!
			<br><br>
			The code that makes up applications on a blockchain are called smart contracts.
			Since these apps use a blockchain as their base layer network, they inherit 
			the same properties. This means a smart contract cannot be changed once it has
			been deployed, and the app can only be taken down by taking down the blockchain
			itself. As long as the blockchain is running, the app can be accessed by users.
			<br><br>
			Besides that, the simple benefit of applications on a blockchain is the 
			separation of the app and our account. We maintain full control of our blockchain
			account and the assets within it, and this is the account we "plug into" the apps
			we want to use on a blockchain. Even when using apps on a blockchain, our assets
			are always within our custody as long as they are within our blockchain account.
			<br><br>
			
			
			<h3>What is Cryptocurrency?</h3>
			While cryptocurrency can be a lot of things, the best way to describe it is
			"blockchain" money, in the same way we have digital money for digital systems.
			Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that exist on the blockchain. It can be a 
			little weird to visualize what a cryptocurrency is compared to other assets 
			we know today.
			<ul>
				<li>We know fiat currencies which are issued by their respective 
				governments (like dollars), and we refer to these as “a dollar” or “a 
				peso”. Except fiat currencies are meant to be stable, and most 
				cryptocurrencies are not stable.</li>
				<li>We know commodities which are found in nature and not issued or 
				created by any entity (like gold), and we refer to these as “an ounce of 
				gold” or “a pound of uranium”. Except commodities are tangible and come 
				from the Earth, and cryptocurrencies are intangible, created digitally, and 
				expand in supply only as they are hard-coded to do.</li>
				<li>We know equities (stocks) which are issued by private companies, and 
				we refer to these as “a share of $AAPL” or “a share of $AMZN". Except 
				shares represent legal ownership of a publicly traded company and its 
				profits, and cryptocurrencies do not represent any legal claim to some 
				company and its profits, nor does there exist this kind of relationship.</li>
			</ul>
			So what gives? If crypto assets are supposed to be digital cash, why aren't they 
			stable? If crypto assets are supposed to be commodities, what are the rules 
			for their creation and why do so many of them exist? If crypto assets are 
			associated with certain networks and apps, what's the point of them existing
			if it's not to share profit earned by a company?
			<br><br>
			Simply put, there is no one-size-fits-all categorization for cryptocurrency,
			crypto assets can quite literally be <em>anything!</em> They are just digital
			assets that inherit the underlying benefits of the blockchain.
			<br><br>
			We can tokenize real world assets like stocks, commodities, and fiat currencies so 
			anyone invest in equities, trade commodities, or hedge downturn in their 
			country's currency with access to "stablecoins" pegged to the US dollar.
			<br><br>
			Crypto assets like Bitcoin may themselves be their own commodity, acting as "digital
			gold" with arguably better features like a hard-coded scarcity, portability,
			censorship-resistance, etc.
			<br><br>
			Cryptocurrency is fundamental in securing public blockchain networks with what is
			known as "cryptoeconomics". To prevent disruptions in consensus, blockchain networks
			are hard-coded to incentivize honest actors contributing to consensus, as well as
			punish dishonest actors attempting to disrupt consensus. This is what makes top
			public networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum so incredibly expensive to attack today.
			<br><br>
			Crypto assets may also be "utility tokens" of some application or network. For
			example, making a transaction on the Ethereum network requires a fee paid in ETH.
			Since no companies or controllers exist over applications built on a blockchain,
			apps may reward users with tokens that can be used to vote on new updates to the
			app, essentially providing a way to give ownership over applications to their 
			users rather than some central company.
			<br><br>
			Even more interestingly, we can create totally unique crypto assets that can
			store information on the blockchain. These can be used to represent things like
			social media accounts, where we can maintain total ownership over a token
			representing our social media profile and all of its data, including our posts and
			followers!
